Today marks two years.

Two long years of taking pills and stabbing myself to put estrogen in my body. Two years of growing my hair out. Two years of learning, firsthand, what being trans really means to me, and how I want to apply that in my life. Two years of learning how to actually live as the woman I wished to be for over 30 years.

Two years of internalizing that I was a woman all along.

It hasn’t been easy. In fact, I’d say that I haven’t been fully successful on any of the counts, except for the whole “putting estrogen into my body” part. Honestly, for me, that was the easy bit. Once I accepted that I was trans, I practically rushed to put girl juice into my veins.
