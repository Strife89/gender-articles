Today marks two years.

Two long years of taking pills and stabbing myself to put estrogen in my body. Two years of growing my hair out. Two years of learning, firsthand, what being trans really means to me, and how I want to apply that in my life. Two years of learning how to actually live as the woman I wished to be for over 30 years.

Two years of internalizing that I was a woman all along.

It hasn’t been easy. In fact, I’d say that I haven’t been fully successful on any of the counts, except for the whole “putting estrogen into my body” part. Honestly, for me, that was the easy bit. Once I accepted that I was trans, I practically rushed to put girl juice into my veins.

As long as we will it in some way, we’re always working on ourselves. It need not be conscious, but we tend to spend a lot of our lives searching for self-improvement, for our core values, for the things that make us tick, for our very soul. I’m not sure how many of us ever find all of those, but I believe we always find some of them, eventually. It’s tough, though. All kinds of factors come at us to muddy the waters, to conceal the truth, or convince us of a different truth, and maybe we never learn enough to know better.

But if you keep searching, and if we all work together to help each other find our identities … it works out in the end.

That’s how it worked for me, at least.

I owe so much to the trans and broader queer communities, and all of our allies, without whom I might never have found myself - maybe even not lived long enough to do so. I didn’t even realize that I was searching for my identity, but I always felt the pull.
